    Hello! Are you a coder looking to scrape our looking glass
    information?  If yes, welcome! You've come to the right place.
    First off, this form was not meant for robots to scrape. Please
    consider contacting us and we'd be happy to try and assist you:

            https://www.pch.net/about/contact

    Otherwise, if you insist on scraping us, you'll need to know some
    tidbits to make your life easier:

    * The actual URL that returns results is here:

            https://www.pch.net/tools/looking_glass_query

    * This URL accepts it's parameters via GET, not POST. They are:

            query=QUERYHERE&args=ARGSHERE&router=ROUTERIDHERE&pch_nonce=NONCEHERE

    * This URL will return JSON in this format:

            [{"nonce":"NONCE HERE","status":"STATUS HERE","result":"RESULT HERE"}]

    * We use nonces to prevent CSRF. This means you'll need to pass
    a nonce both in the query string as denoted above *and* in the cookies you
    send with with your GET to looking_glass_query. Here's a snippet we published
    to show how to login using nonces. You should be able to adopt this your uses
    on this page:

            https://github.com/Packet-Clearing-House/gists/blob/master/IMPACT.wget.recursive.sh

    * the result returned in JSON is HTML with "<br />\n" inline

    All this said, even if you're going to scrape us, please do contact us.
    We want to help you!
